# MyTutor

MyTutor is an android APP, who focuses on helping students, from First Grade until senior year in HS. It has all of your school subjects, you can choose the one you want to learn/practice, have a 5-10 minute read,
and as soon as you feel as the concepts have entered in your brain, by osmosis ofc lel :/, you can take a short quiz, 5-6 questions, multiple choice of course, no one what's to make others lives harder...
It has a simple yet slick design, with a very intuitive UI. It's not built yet, it is in progress, I still have to commit the latest changes I've done, but I have been lazy as hell...
 This is some sort of my side project, but something cool to help me learn new technologies, specially because it was originaly made in JAVA and I have switched to Kotlin.
 
 It has (or will have):
 -Login Section (I'm doing the back-end with Firebase)
 -Main page, with the user's lastest classes taken and how they are doing this week/month, still working on that
 -Everyone will be able to check how they did on previous classes and can even retake the quizzes in order to get a better score or to revise that part of the matter.
 -Classes -> Refactored into smaller particles, e.g, a month worth of learning into 10 small classes, which will consiste 5-10 minute reading and a 5-6 multiple choice like questions.
 -A leaderboard, so you can track how well you are doing comparing to other people from your city/country/school year.
 -Forum where users can ask questions to each other, compare scores, etc... (this one could only be separated by school year and country, I believe that it doesn't change from city to city, at least at where I'm from)
 
 
 That will be pretty much it, with the features I will include later, as I remember cool stuff to add. I will also launch it on Google Play, as soon as I am done and it will be 100% for free,
  no one likes to do 2 lessons and be asked for 15$/month. 100% free, forever.
