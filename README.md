<h2> Problem faced:</h2> <br>
<p> The problem I am trying to solve is the boredom that students face when trying to study for school. They hate to have to  read textbooks, then go and practice, this whole way of studying sounds outdated.</p>
 
  <h2>Solution</h2>
 To solve this problem, I combined easiness and technology. Every student has access to a smartphone and an internet connection, therefore I am developing this app that uses gamification and turns boring studying into something attractive and interesting. 
 The student will pick out his school year, choose the subject they wish to study or just practice, and go through a simple syllabus, and later on, they will do a 5-10 minute multiple-choice quiz. By using this kind of method the students will keep a score and be able to improve and do more by doing less.<br><br><br>
 


 
 # It has (or will have):<br>
* Login Section (I'm doing the back-end with Firebase)<br>
* Main page, with the user's lastest classes taken and how they are doing this week/month, still working on that<br>
* Everyone will be able to check how they did on previous classes and can even retake the quizzes in order to get a better score or to revise that part of the matter.<br>
* Classes -> Refactored into smaller particles, e.g, a month worth of learning into 10 small classes, which will consiste 5-10 minute reading and a 5-6 multiple choice like questions.<br>
* A leaderboard, so you can track how well you are doing comparing to other people from your city/country/school year.<br>
* Forum where users can ask questions to each other, compare scores, etc... (this one could only be separated by school year and country, I believe that it doesn't change from city to city, at least at where I'm from) <br>
 
 
 That will be pretty much it, with the features I will include later, as I remember cool stuff to add. I will also launch it on Google Play, as soon as I am done and it will be 100% for free,
  no one likes to do 2 lessons and be asked for 15$/month. 100% free, forever.
